# Simple Vanilla Deployment Test

This is a minimal **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** website created to test automated deployments.

## Purpose

- Verify GitHub repository cloning
- Validate deployment to `/var/www`
- Confirm static hosting works (e.g., Nginx)
- Ensure JavaScript loads and executes correctly

## Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML page
- `styles.css` – Basic styling
- `script.js` – Simple JavaScript interaction

## Expected Result

When deployed and opened in a browser:

1. Page loads with styled content
2. Clicking the button updates the message text
3. Confirms HTML, CSS, and JS are served correctly
